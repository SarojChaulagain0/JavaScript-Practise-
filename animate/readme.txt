    CSS Styling:
        The #container style sets the dimensions, position, and background color of the container div.
        The #animate style sets the dimensions, position, and background color of the animated element within the container.

    HTML Structure:
        There's a button with the text "Click Me" that, when clicked, triggers the myMove JavaScript function.
        The container div (#container) holds the animated element div (#animate).

    JavaScript: The myMove function is triggered by the button click. It initializes variables, clears any existing animation interval, 
        and sets up a new interval calling the frame function every 5 milliseconds.

        The frame function is the animation logic. It checks if the element has reached the right and 
        bottom boundaries of the container (at position 350 pixels in this case). 
        If reached, it clears the interval to stop the animation. If not reached, 
        it increments the position variables and updates the element's position, creating a diagonal movement effect.
